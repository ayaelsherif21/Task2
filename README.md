# Task2
# Categorize Numbers as Even or Odd

This is a Dart program that categorizes a list of numbers into even or odd using a `for` loop and `switch case`.

## Features
- Iterates through a list of numbers
- Uses a `for` loop to traverse the list
- Uses `switch case` to determine if the number is even or odd

## Code Explanation
1. A list of numbers from 1 to 10 is defined.
2. The program loops through each number in the list.
3. The `switch case` checks whether the number is even (remainder 0) or odd (remainder 1).

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Dart file (`Task2.dart`) and run it in your Dart environment.
